## Today I finally bought a Domain

The recent release of the .dev TLD prompted me to finally get around to buy
a domain, and in turn to finally get around to creating a blog. Unfortunately,
even though the TLD is new, farley.dev has been bought by someone else and is
available for sale.

Considering my name is Ben, I've settled with 
[benfarley.dev](https://benfarley.dev). :smile:

Hopefully having this site/blog will actually prompt me to put my thoughts and
findings into something that can be used by others.
